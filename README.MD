# C-hangman
A CLI hangman game written in C.

## Usage:
Here's an example of a round where I clearly cheated:
```
./hangman
The word has 9 letters
How many tries do you want?
> 7

You have 7 tries left and have used the letters:
WORD: - - - - - - - - -
Letter: o

You have 7 tries left and have used the letters: O
WORD: - - - - O - - - -
Letter: m

[...]

You have 7 tries left and have used the letters: O, M, I, R, C, W, A, E
WORD: M I C R O W A - E
Letter: v

--- YOU WON! ---
The word was MICROWAVE

Do you want to play again? (Y/n)
